				<h3>Strategic Design</h3>
				<p>Strategic design is really an oxymoron. Design really means strategic. My job as a designer is to strategically reach specific audience. As technology evolve, a company really needs to tab into marketers and designers to adjust and work together to ideally to improve communication. To keep the doors open, I understand why companies has to watch their bottomline numbers; however, what I don’t understand is why some of us keep practicing tautology. If only accountants will speak to designers and IT department work side by side with the marketers?</p>

				<h3>Digital Communication</h3>
				<p>According to Google search, paper was invented around 100 BC and it seems it took more than 2000 years to start the beginning of a digital age. Today, the technology seems to evolving faster than speed of light. Just over 40 years, the world fully connected and you can reach billions of people in matter of seconds. As marketers and designers – websites, landing pages and email campaigns are no longer just an option, it's a must!</p>

				<h3>Packaging</h3>
				<p>I think that packaging designers are lucky in sense, it may never go away from the market. In order to sell something, you need to wrap it, like the clothing you wrap yourself. Packaging for me is very exciting for the fact that it deals with both form and function. Starting from a flat two dimensional mediums turning into something that comes alive with the advertisement on the front, the possibilities are endless.</p>

				<h3>Signage and Decals</h3>
				<p>Every graphics manual starts with identity and signage usage. This is because signage represents literally who you are. The psychology that may go into a signage is mind boggling for me. Although signs can be nauseating when it’s not regulated, without signs, who are we? After all, it's your brand.</p>

				<h3>Exhibits and Events</h3>
				<p>Running a exhibits and events reminds me of a intricate popup book. You are in that short hour or in few days, you are trying to tell a great story about who you are as a company. What great things you have for your consumers/customers/clients/purchasing agents to buy in your story. From signs to kiosks, collateral material all have to be strategically placed and rehearsed so your audience may alway and come back for the largest purchase order. What I love about the tradeshow exhibits are all the giveaway swags and trinkets so that you will be remembered who you are. Umm, does your product work?</p>

				<h3>Forms and Labels</h3>
				<p>This may be my only observation but I think that forms, labels and infographics reveal your intelligence as a company. I think this is because people thinks no-body really cares about these things. When was last time you filled out a form and paper and said to yourself, this company really thought about this. To me, it really shows the intelligence because it really shows they cared about something that would be trivial to some. The labels can be so powerful, when you are locked out because of your garage door or when your water heater just burst, that label what closes the deal. Don’t you think?</p>

				<h3>Video, Kiosks, Presentations and Infographics</h3>
				<p>These projects are perhaps one of the most difficult assignments. For one, you cannot just make a video because you understand you know how to use editing apps. Same things goes with kiosks and presentations because without the intelligent script, it’s like talking about a book without actually reading about it. To me, presentation and infographics are the same thing where it takes deep understanding about your subject but about your audience, especially for these mediums. For example, map was early onset of infographics. Instead of bunch of words to describe a direction, it showed visually where you are going. So, what is the message?</p>
