							<p>The traditional Roman Catholic meditative prayer form, the rosary, is based on movement &mdash; the movement of fingers on beads.</p>
							<p>Michele has expanded the movement of the rosary's prayer intentions, scripture stories, and repetitive prayers to the entire body.</p>
							
						<div class="moreRosary">
							<div>
								<ul>
									<li><h3>Private Movement Prayer</h3>
									Having deepened her own personal prayer by moving through the rosary, Michele now teaches others how to develop private movement meditation practices. People who participate in her retreats and prayer hours find their personal rosary prayer deepened. They expand their prayer movement beyond their fingers to their entire bodies. A simple walking meditation may transform into a private dance.</li>
									
									<li><h3>Participatory Retreats</h3> 
									At retreats and prayer hours, Michele guides people, whether they consider themselves dancers or not, in moving through the rosary themselves. The rosary is so rich, so full of layers that it provides a plush structure within which to explore movement. Participants’ movement prayer may focus on any one of the three intertwined elements of the rosary – the prayer intention, the scripturally-based mystery meditation, or the repetitive bead prayers. It may also flow effortlessly between them. </li>
									
									<li><h3>Rosary Dance Prayer Hour Presentations</h3>
									Michele puts the rosary in motion for others to witness as they sit and pray. She memorizes, proclaims, enacts, and dances the rosary’s scripture stories by herself or with others as part of a retreat or prayer hour. She then leads participants in praying the repetitive prayers in a way that reflects their mysteries. Sometimes, the prayers may be prayed silently, sometimes out loud, sometimes sung. She may dance to the rhythm of the spoken prayers.

					<h2>Michele has been dancing since she could walk...</h2>
					<p>… studying and performing modern dance, ballet, mime, improvisation and creative movement.  During worship, movement and gestures can mediate between the human and the divine, transcending words and increasing the reverence of celebrations.</p>
					<div class="moreMichele"> 
						<p>In Chicago, Michele performed as a modern dancer at Link’s Hall, the Chicago Cultural
						Center, and the Blue Rider Theater. Then, in the early 1990’s at St. Thomas
						Apostle Church, she saw a sacred dance concert choreographed by Maggie Kast.
						Taken by how the setting deepened the meaning of the dancers’ gestures, Michele
						recognized that the same movements performed on a stage would not have been
						nearly as compelling. Captivated ever since by the context-specific dance form
						of liturgical dance, she has worked primarily as a soloist in Roman Catholic,
						Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, and other Protestant<a
						href="#testimonial"> Christian
						churches </a> as well as ecumenical and interfaith settings in the
						greater Chicago area.</p>

						<p>Michele has led well-received Lord's Prayer, rosary movement prayer, and liturgical minister
						movement training retreats and prayer hours at numerous churches and retreat
						centers. She has choreographed and taught simple congregational movement for
						the <a href="#lordsprayer">Lord's Prayer </a>. Michele also developed a
						meditative movement form, <a href="#rosary">Rosary in Motion, </a>which was featured on WTTW's<i> 30 Good
						Minutes.</i></p>

								<p class="occasion">Easter Sunrise Worship</p>
								<p class="date">March 27, 2016, 6:30am</p>
								<p>After gathering around a vigil fire and remembering stories Jesus
								had told us, and then reflecting on how people anointed bodies for burial in
								biblical times, we ventured out to a mounded tomb in the church cemetery.
								There, dressed in red, I proclaimed the story of Mary Magdalene at the tomb,
								which I have memorized from John (This time it was 20:1, 11-18a which focused
								on Mary's story). Upon conclusion, the congregation sang &quot;Christ the Lord
								Is Risen Today&quot; and I danced. We then went into the church to share
								communion and then breakfast. It was very special to be able to tell the story
								of Mary Magdalene at the tomb that first Easter morning, outside, at a tomb,
								early on a Easter morning!</p>
